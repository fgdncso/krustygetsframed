A Simpsons themed image guessing game inspired by the game framed.wtf (which was inspired by wordle)
This is my first project and I really just wanted to see if I could do it. I started with just a button that would load a random image from an array,
then added more and more on top of that.
The code is admittedly unorganized, but it works mostly as intended and the project was just for fun!
